# ircloggr-react-ui

All credits goes to [@vjeux][0] who implemented this UI as http://jsfiddle.net/vjeux/QL9tz/

This is a version of the same UI which use [react-app][1]. The app serves as an
example of React application which

  * pre-renders UI on a server-side
  * seeds UI with data from an external API (which could be also your own API)
